                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce deep equilibrium nets (DEQNs)&mdash;a deep learning-based method to compute approximate functional rational expectations equilibria of economic models 
                            featuring a significant amount of heterogeneity, uncertainty, and occasionally binding constraints. DEQNs are neural networks trained in an unsupervised 
                            fashion to satisfy all equilibrium conditions along simulated paths of the economy. Since DEQNs approximate the equilibrium functions directly, simulating 
                            the economy is computationally cheap, and training data can be generated at virtually zero cost. We demonstrate that DEQNs can accurately solve economically 
                            relevant models by applying them to two challenging life-cycle models and a Bewley-style model with aggregate risk. </p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce a comprehensive computational framework for solving dynamic portfolio choice problems with many risky assets, transaction costs, and borrowing 
                            and short-selling constraints. Our approach leverages the synergy between Gaussian process regression and Bayesian active learning to efficiently approximate 
                            value and policy functions with a novel, formal way of characterizing the irregularly-shaped no-trade region; we then embed this into a discrete-time dynamic 
                            programming algorithm. This combination allows us to study dynamic portfolio choice problems with more risky assets than was previously possible. Our results 
                            indicate that giving the agent access to more assets may alleviate some illiquidity resulting from the presence of transaction costs. </p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Do stock prices of publicly listed companies respond to changes in trading costs?
                            We document a significant and asymmetric effect of tick-size changes on prices by
                            leveraging a novel policy framework that allows for a causal randomized control trial
                            difference-in-differences analysis. The doubling of the tick size leads to a decrease in
                            prices by 0.9% to 1.3%, whereas halving the tick size results in an increase of 3.3%
                            to 3.5%. The price effect is more pronounced in smaller firms and tick-unconstrained
                            stocks. We report substantial excess returns on the day before the tick-size change
                            attributable to quote and price clustering and, with caution, to strategic short-term
                            price manipulation. </p>

                        <h3>Which Shoes Fit This Dress? Using Product Images to Infer “Perfect Pairings” Across Categories Without Supervision</h3>
                        <p>Luca Gaegauf and <a href="https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/faculty/all/markus-meierer/" class="coauthor-hlink">Markus Meierer</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Product recommendations are omnipresent and contribute significantly to the revenue of online retail businesses. Nevertheless, customers often complain 
                            about the quality of recommendations. A possible explanation is that the requirements of existing approaches are not always met. The increasing speed 
                            of product assortment changes challenges collaborative filter techniques, which are subject to the cold start problem. Alternative approaches such as 
                            preference- or content-based recommendations systems require detailed structured information (e.g., on product characteristics or previous customer 
                            purchase patterns), which is often not available. Addressing this challenge, the authors propose an unsupervised approach to infer recommendations across 
                            domains solely based on product images. With the increasing interest in deep learning techniques, convolutional neural networks have been used to infer 
                            single-domain recommendations based on the intrinsic information of product images (e.g., recommend alternative dresses based on the image of a dress). 
                            Albeit promising, approaches to infer cross-domain recommendations are largely unexplored. Using generative adversarial networks and convolutional neural 
                            networks to leverage the implicit information in product images, the authors propose an unsupervised approach to make recommendations across product 
                            categories (e.g., recommend shoes based on an image of a dress). The performance of the approach is assessed by benchmarking to various empirical baselines 
                            as well as surveying potential customers on the perceived quality of the recommendations. Further, the authors discuss two extensions: (1) Making 
                            recommendations for multiple other domains based on a single product image as input and (2) making cross-domain recommendations based on multiple product 
                            images as input. Concluding, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. </p>
