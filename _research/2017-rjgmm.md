excerpt: 'Using many moment conditions is a well-known remedy for generalized method of moments’ (GMMs) imprecision. However, it comes at the cost of an increased bias and/or instability of the weighting matrix. We focus on scenarios where the dimension of available moment conditions may be larger than the sample size and where the signal contained in the moments may not be sparse. In such situations, consistent estimation of the standard GMM estimator is not possible without regularization. Model selection methods have demonstrated their ineptitude in these scenarios. We propose a jackknife GMM (JGMM) estimator with regularization at each jackknife iteration. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the proposed ridge-regularized JGMM (RJGMM) estimator’s finite-sample properties and provide evidence that it performs favorably relative to other estimation strategies that are valid in many- weak moment settings.'
